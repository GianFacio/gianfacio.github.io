      <h1>Why use these technologies ?</h1>
      <h2> Creating the Resident Assistant App using Angular for the first time was an exciting challenge. It required me to learn new skills and apply them in a practical way. The process was both rewarding and challenging as I had to learn how to use Angular's components, services, and modules to create a functional and responsive web application.
        Bootstrap was essential for the look of the app, as it provided a set of predefined CSS classes and components that allowed me to create a modern and responsive design quickly. Additionally, I used other technologies like MySQL to make the application work as I wanted it to, allowing me to store data and retrieve it as needed.
        Overall, creating this web app using Angular and other technologies was an important challenge that helped me grow as a developer. It allowed me to expand my skills, learn new tools, and create something meaningful and useful for others.  </h2>

      <h1>Future of the app ?</h1>
      <h2>Expanding the Resident Assistant App to other schools would involve customizing the application to fit the specific needs and requirements of each school. The core functionality of the app, such as managing events, announcements, and resident information, would remain the same. However, the app's design, branding, and features would need to be adjusted to reflect each school's unique culture and requirements.
        One way to enhance the app's functionality would be to add a profile feature for actual residents to use. This would allow residents to view their own information, such as their room assignment, meal plan, and contact information. They could also use the app to view upcoming events, sign up for activities, and communicate with other residents.
        To implement this feature, the app would need to integrate with the school's student information system and other data sources. This would allow the app to retrieve and display accurate and up-to-date information for each resident.
        Overall, expanding the Resident Assistant App to different schools and adding a profile feature for residents would increase the app's usefulness and make it an indispensable tool for managing residential life. It would also provide an opportunity to improve the app's design, functionality, and user experience to meet the needs of a wider audience.</h2>
